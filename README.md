# PMM Insights Demo

This project was created as part of my product marketing and technical writing learning path.  
Itâ€™s a live demo deployed on **Render** and connected to this GitHub repository to show that I can work comfortably in a developer environment.

### Purpose
To demonstrate my ability to:
- Use developer tools like **GitHub** and **Render**
- Translate a technical setup into clear, repeatable steps
- Combine marketing strategy with hands-on technical understanding

### How It Was Built
I collaborated with **ChatGPT** and **Claude** to generate and refine the base code using **natural language prompts**, combining that with my own **HTML knowledge** to edit, customize, and structure the final version.  
This process mirrors how I often work in real-world product content â€” combining AI-assisted ideation with hands-on editing and technical insight.

### Tools Used
- **GitHub** â€” version control and hosting the source code  
- **Render** â€” deployment platform for the live site  
- **HTML / Markdown** â€” content structure and formatting  
- **Natural Language Processing (NLP)** â€” AI-assisted code generation and refinement
